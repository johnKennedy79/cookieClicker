# cookieClicker

I didn't build a wire frame diagram as I felt the layout was quite simple but one of the things that I do when designing any web page is to place a 1 pixel boarder around my HTML elements so that I can position them on the page and in relationship to each other this gives me a basic layout of were my elements are going to go.

for my cookie button I styled it using an copy write free vector inside the button and made it round so that it best fitted the image.

I added keyframe animations that start when you click the multiplyer buttons and included the event listeners for all 4 of the buttons.  
and also added a custom pointer in the shape of a sceletons hand.
